# MedFund

This was created as an exercise for an internet technology class at university. As an app it is still in the beginning stages. 

The idea behind MedFund was to create a specialized crowdfunding and resource center for those struggling with illness. 
I envisioned a highly personalized space for people to reach out to others, express their individalized 
needs, and to get help from caring and generous people.

Profiles are automatically created when the user logs in. Currently the user must have a google account to log in the future 
I would add more options. Once the user logs in and the profile is created the user can edit their profile and 
save it for the future. Profiles are stored in a SQL database which stores name, email, id number, the id number
given from google, information the user would like people to know about, and ideally a photo they can upload. I would like 
to integrate a shopping cart and a paypal type of donation system.  
The backend is built in node.js and express. The front end in HTML/CSS and vanilla javascript. 
Future development includes linking users to available resources, as well as a rich search feature for trying to find someone.
